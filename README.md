# Task 9: Client-Side Form Validation Using JavaScript

## Project Description
In this task, I implemented a robust client-side validation system for a registration form. I focused on preventing incorrect data entry and providing immediate, meaningful feedback to users without reloading the page.

## Key Features Implemented
* **Custom Validation Logic**: Disabled default HTML validation to have full control via JavaScript.
* **Regex Integration**: Used regular expressions to verify email formats and ensure password security.
* **Submission Control**: Utilized `preventDefault()` to halt form submission until all validation conditions are met.
* **Dynamic Feedback**: Implemented error messages that appear directly below inputs and used CSS classes to highlight valid/invalid states.
* **Code Refactoring**: Organized validation checks into reusable functions for cleaner code.
